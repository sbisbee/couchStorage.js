couchStorage.js
===============

THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. No, really, this is mostly hot off my brain. Things
you can not depend on: the API, code, interfaces, and dependencies. Things you
can depend on: it will sync with CouchDB and obey the Storage interface.

Read couchStorage.js's comments for documentation. Rather, documentation coming
soon.
